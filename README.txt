===========
PushoverPy provides a simple api to pushover.net, and a command line client. Sending messages is as easy as::
    from PushoverPy import Pushover
    
    Api = Pushover(User_Key, Api_Token)
    Api.send('Hello World')
	
Development is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/T-Mac/PushoverPy/blob/master/Pushover.py>`_.
